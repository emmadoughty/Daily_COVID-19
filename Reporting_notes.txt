Image reads that on 31/03 10421 tests were carried out and 7511 people were tested, inpatient test capacity is 12799.

We've moved the point at which we count new cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) back a few hours, so the number of new cases is from a shorter period today. Apologies for any confusion this has caused."
10/04/2020 - Tweets from DHSC (https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1248659493610758144) and https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public mention that positive tests now include HCWs and their households but also states number of positive cases through pillar 1 testing. COVID19_by_day.csv will continue to include positive cases arising from pillar 1 testing only and I'll make a new file for further testing/case strategies. There's some things that don't make sense to me and I'll look into them tomorrow.

10/04/2020 - PHE dashboard: "England and Scotland case counts are as of 09:00 10/04/2020, Wales case count is as of 07:00 10/04/2020, Northern Ireland case count is as of 12:02 10/04/2020.

11/04/2020 - From https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#history: "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for positive cases is 1 lower than the daily increase figure. This is due to Wales double counting a case from the previous day." so I adjusted new cases on 10/04/2020 from 18668 to 18667 and cumulative cases from 316837 to 316836 on the COVID19_by_day.csv file.
11/04/2020 - From https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#history: "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for number of cases is 47 lower than the daily increase figures. This is due to PHE correcting some errors in their historical data." Looking at the numbers, I'm a bit confused. The difference between cumulative TESTS reported on 10/04 and 11/04 is 18138 whilst a daily increase of 18091 was reported (47 difference, but the difference between the cumulative figures is 47 HIGHER, not lower?). I can't see any issue between the number of new cases reported today and the differences between cumulative figures? To maintain the "rules" I have set out in my readme for what is in this file, I will CumTests will be as reported and NewTests will be the calculated difference as stated. II'll think about a better way of displaying this data going forward.
