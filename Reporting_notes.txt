13/03/2020 - For NI (and rest of UK?): "On the 13th March, the case definition also changed such that testing was limited to acute Trust admissions only. This will likely lead to a reduction in the total number of tests being performed and an increase in the positivity rate."

Testing capacity for inpatient care in England currently stands at 12,799 tests per day." Image reads that on 31/03 10421 tests were carried out and 7511 people were tested, inpatient test capacity is 12799. This does not fit with the increase of 8240 people tested between 30/03 and 31/03, nor the 9793 between 31/03 and 01/04. Unclear when this testing period on 31/03 was defined/reported.

In my collated data this is "NA" to maintain machine-readable format.
08/04/2020 - PHE dashboard/UK gov shows 70 deaths for NI; NI reports 78 deaths (https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/sites/default/files/2020-04/COVID-19%20Surveillance%20Bulletin%2008.04.20.pdf)

09/04/2020 - From Public Health Wales tweet (https://twitter.com/PublicHealthW/status/1248234293069000705): "Due to a change in our reporting process, today we are reporting a lower than usual number of new cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wales. 16 new cases have tested positive for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wales. We've moved the point at which we count new cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) back a few hours, so the number of new cases is from a shorter period today. Apologies for any confusion this has caused."
10/04/2020 - Tweets from DHSC (https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1248659493610758144) and https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public mention that positive tests now include HCWs and their households but also states number of positive cases through pillar 1 testing. COVID19_by_day.csv will continue to include positive cases arising from pillar 1 testing only and I'll make a new file for further testing/case strategies. There's some things that don't make sense to me and I'll look into them tomorrow.
10/04/2020 - DHSC tweet: "The "tests" figures exclude data from Northern Ireland."
10/04/2020 - Scotland reports 495 deaths; PHE dashboard/UK gov shows 447 deaths for Scotland
10/04/2020 - PHE dashboard/UK gov shows 82 deaths for NI; NI reports 92 deaths (https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/sites/default/files/2020-04/COVID-19%20Surveillance%20Bulletin%2010.04.20.pdf)
10/04/2020 - PHE dashboard: "England and Scotland case counts are as of 09:00 10/04/2020, Wales case count is as of 07:00 10/04/2020, Northern Ireland case count is as of 12:02 10/04/2020. England and Wales death counts are as of 17:00 09/04/2020, Scotland death count is as of 09:00 09/04/2020, Northern Ireland death count is as of 09:15 09/04/2020."
11/04/2020 - From https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#history: "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for positive cases is 1 lower than the daily increase figure. This is due to Wales double counting a case from the previous day." so I adjusted new cases on 10/04/2020 from 18668 to 18667 and cumulative cases from 316837 to 316836 on the COVID19_by_day.csv file.
11/04/2020 - From https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#history: "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for number of cases is 47 lower than the daily increase figures. This is due to PHE correcting some errors in their historical data." Looking at the numbers, I'm a bit confused. The difference between cumulative TESTS reported on 10/04 and 11/04 is 18138 whilst a daily increase of 18091 was reported (47 difference, but the difference between the cumulative figures is 47 HIGHER, not lower?). I can't see any issue between the number of new cases reported today and the differences between cumulative figures? To maintain the "rules" I have set out in my readme for what is in this file, I will CumTests will be as reported and NewTests will be the calculated difference as stated. II'll think about a better way of displaying this data going forward.
11/04/2020 - DHSC tweet: "The "tests" figures exclude data from Northern Ireland."
11/04/2020 - Scotland reports 542 deaths; PHE dashboard/UK gov shows 495 deaths for Scotland

THE ONE DAY LAG FOR DEATHS IN SCOTLAND AND NI SEEMS TO CONTINUE. TESTS ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE THOSE CONDUCTED IN NI
14/04/2020 - From PHE dashboard: "Case counts for England are provided by Public Health England. Death counts and data for Devolved Administrations are provided by the Department of Health and Social Care. Maps include Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2020 and Office for National Statistics data © Crown copyright and database right 2020. England and Scotland case counts are as of 09:00 14/04/2020, Wales case count is as of 07:00 14/04/2020, Northern Ireland case count is as of 09:30 14/04/2020. Death counts are as of 13/04/2020 (see About the data for times). UK total includes cases detected through "Pillar 2" testing (tests carried out by commercial partners) and therefore does not equate to the sum of the four countries' counts, which only include "Pillar 1" (tests carried out by NHS/PHE/devolved administration labs). Time series data will be available to download from 15/04/2020."
14/04/2020 - https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public: "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and from yesterday for number of cases is 1 off the daily increase figures. This is due to PHE correcting some errors in their historical data."
15/04/2020 - DHSC tweet: "The difference between the cumulative numbers for today and yesterday for "number of tests" is 272 off the daily increase figures due to PHE correcting some errors in their historical data." As a consequence, I have modified the cumulative number of cases on 14/04 from 382650 to 382922 to account for this variation as much as possible.
15/04/2020 - https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public reports 87536 positive pillar 1 tests yesterday and 91325 today. The difference between these is 3789 but a daily increase of 3971 is reported. I have used the reported values for COVID_by_day.csv.
15/04/2020 - "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for “number of positive cases” is 2 off the daily increase figures, this is due to Wales removing duplicates from their historic data." This seems to be about total cases reported and pillar 1 cases reported. Cumulative pillar 1 cases reduced by 2 for 14/04.
16/04/2020 - https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public: "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for “number of tests” is 68 off the daily increase figures, this is due to PHE correcting some errors in their historical data.
The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for “number of positive cases” is 1 off the daily increase figures, this is due to Wales removing duplicates from their historic data." 1) seems to be about the total number of tests conducted, not people tested so cumulative total for 15/04 has been decreased by 68 as the best I can do to improve the data. 2) Is about totoal number of cases and doesn't seem to impact pillar 1 cases.
17/04/2020 - DHSC tweet: "The difference between the cumulative numbers for today and yesterday for "number of tests" is 14 off the daily increase figures due to PHE correcting some historical data." This seems to be about the total number of tests conducted, not people tested so cumulative total for 16/04 has been decreased by 14 as the best I can do to improve the data.
18/04/2020 - DHSC tweet: "The difference between the cumulative numbers for today and yesterday for "number of tests" is 57 off the daily increase figures due to PHE correcting some historical data and Wales removing a duplicate from their historical data." This seems to be about the total number of tests conducted, not people tested so cumulative total for 16/04 has been increased by 57 as the best I can do to improve the data.
18/04/2020 - https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public: "The difference between the cumulative numbers from today and yesterday for “number of positive cases” is 1 off the daily increase figures. This is due to Wales removing a duplicate from their historic data." This is for total number of cases and pillar 1 cases, cases on 17/04 reduced by 1 as  the only way to improve the data with the info available
